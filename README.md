# Siamese Neural Network Project

This project is submitted as part of the course requirements.

## Description
This project implements a Siamese Neural Network for image-based learning.
The model is trained and evaluated using a training and validation dataset.
Performance results are visualized using a loss curve and a confusion matrix.

## Repository Contents
- Code/: contains the source code of the project
- confusion_matrix.png: evaluation results
- loss_curve.png: training loss visualization

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is not included in this repository due to size limitations.

Expected dataset structure:

Data/
├── Test/
└── Train/

Please place the dataset inside the `Data/` folder before running the code.

## Trained Model
The trained model file (`siamese_trained.pth`) is not included in this repository because it exceeds GitHub file size limits.

## How to Run
1. Create a Python virtual environment
2. Install the required libraries
3. Run the main script from the `Code/` directory

## Notes
This repository is provided for academic evaluation purposes.
